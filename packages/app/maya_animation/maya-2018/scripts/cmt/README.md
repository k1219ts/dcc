# cmt
cmt is a collection of various Maya tools I have written for my personal projects.

* Unit test runner for Maya tools.

# Installation Instructions
cmt is Maya module that can be installed like all other Maya modules.  You can do one of the following:

* Add the cmt root directory to the MAYA_MODULE_PATH environment variable.
* Add the cmt root directory to the MAYA_MODULE_PATH in your Maya.env.  e.g.  MAYA_MODULE_PATH += /path/to/cmt
* Edit the cmt.mod file, and replace the ./ with the full path to the cmt root directory, then copy the cmt.mod file to where your modules are loaded from.
